Creating an Android App

 

Android Tic-Tac-Toe

 

Overview:  Create a Tic-Tac-Toe application that written for Android.

 

Interface:  The playing field should consist of nine buttons laid out in a 3x3 grid.  (10 points)  

 

Implementation:  When you press a button in the grid, it should change the label to be an “X” (and disable the button).  The computer should then place an “O” somewhere in the grid (and disable the button).  If either player wins, create a Toast that says which player won, and reset the grid. (20 points)

 

The computer should be smarter than just randomly picking an open spot.  Check for wins, then check for blocking X, and finally pick randomly.  (5 points)
