Design Cycle: Group Project Overview

 

Code:

This is what percentage of your code is working.  The total of 100 points will vary based on what has been agreed upon with your design document.  If you only get 50% of the features done, you will get 50 points on the coding section.

 

Documentation:

Most of this score is around writing a user manual.  30 points will be on how readable your manual is.  It must cover EVERY feature of your program.  Screenshots are a good idea for demonstrating how to use it.  The other 20 points are commenting your code.
