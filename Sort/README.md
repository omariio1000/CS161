Sorting Algorithms

 

Overview:  Create a program that sorts an input file using different sorting algorithms.

 

Interface:  The program should ask which sorting algorithm you want to use at the command line, and which input file to use.

 

Implementation:  The program must read in an input file. Use an array to hold each of the incoming numbers. (5 points)

The program must sort each of the numbers using bubble sort. (10 points)

The program must sort each of the numbers using selection sort. (10 points)

The program must sort each of the numbers using table (counting) sort. (10 points)

The program must sort each of the numbers using quicksort. (You will have to research this on your own.) (5 points)

Output the list into an output file, and print out (to both the file and System.out) how long the sort took. (Your start time should be AFTER reading the file in; your end time should be when the array is sorted but BEFORE you output to a file.).  (Hint: Look at System.currentTimeMillis() ) (5 points)
