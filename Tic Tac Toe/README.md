Tic-Tac-Toe

 

Overview:  Create a tic-tac-toe game using the command line.

Interface:  Output the tic-tac-toe grid in the command line.  Input your move on the command line.  Keep track of how many times X wins instead O wins. This will be a two player game.

Implementation:  Use a two-dimensional array to store moves, but display it to the user with letters and numbers to allow them to enter a move.  (10 points)

Example:

1	2	3
a	X		
b		X	O
c	O		
 

Have the user enter a move, check to see if the move is legal, and enter the move if it is legal. (10 points) Start with X.  After each move, check to see if the board contains a win or a tie.  Reset the board and show winning totals if they win/tie (how many times X has won, how many times O has won). Then redraw the board. (20 points)
